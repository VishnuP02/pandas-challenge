Task: Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
Background: For this assignment, I had to put myself in a position as the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I then aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Resources used in completion of challenge
    - Lecture Slides, Class Recordings, Tutoring session w/ Mark Fullton, and AskBCS sessions with Tristen Ortiz


# Analysis
- District Summary:
    An all-encompassing overview of the entire school district is given in the District Summary. The district has 15 schools and 39,170 students enrolled overall. With average reading and math scores of 81.88 and 78.99, respectively, the performance is fairly balanced. The district's passing percentage of 65.17% indicates that there is room for growth. To increase student's overall academic performance, careful attention to both subject-specific and combined competency is required.
  
- School Summary:
    In this section, each of the 15 schools in the district are examined individually. With the greatest overall passing rate of 95.21%, Holden High stands out and may serve as a model for excellent practices. On the other hand, Johnson Middle School's lower passing percentage of 63.85% suggests that specific interventions may be needed in this area. This section also shows differences in the average reading and math scores among schools, highlighting the necessity of specialized teaching methods to address particular issues and build on each institution's advantages. 
    
- Top and Bottom Performing Schools:
    All of the top performing schools - including Holden High, which has a 95.21% passing rate - achieve remarkable academic performance. These educational institutions can act as models for good curriculum implementation and instructional strategies. On the other hand, Johnson Middle School's passing percentage of 63.85% indicates that it is among the bottom performing schools, which also confronts difficulties. It is imperative to pinpoint and tackle the elements causing these schools' poor performance in order to enhance district-wide educational results.

- Math and Reading Scores by Grade:
    There are only little differences in scores between grades according to the math scores by grade, which show consistent performance patterns across schools. The reading scores by grade, on the other hand, show certain schools' improved proficiency in higher grades, suggesting the possibility of success for literacy-focused efforts. Replicating effective reading practices and figuring out what influences steady math results can help improve the district's overall student performance.

- Scores by School Spending:
    Academic achievement and per-student spending have a complex relationship, according to the scores by school spending research. Remarkably, schools with lower per-student spending frequently outperform their higher-spending peers, showing competitive or even superior scores. This casts doubt on widely held beliefs on the relationship between financial support and academic achievement. According to the statistics, a deeper investigation into the precise distribution and application of resources inside educational institutions is necessary in order to pinpoint practical methods for maximizing academic performance in the face of financial limitations.

- Scores by School Size:
    Notable trends are shown by breaking down the scores according to school size. Less than 2000 pupils attend small and medium-sized schools, which routinely score better in reading and math than do large schools. According to the research, smaller schools often have better overall passing rates due to higher average scores and a higher percentage of children passing both math and reading exams. This emphasizes how keeping lower student populations in schools may help students succeed academically.

- Scores by School Type:
    There is a clear difference between charter and district schools when the scores are broken down by kind of school. Average math and reading scores are regularly better at charter schools, and the proportion of children passing both courses is noticeably higher as well. The information backs up the claim that academic achievement in charter schools is higher than in typical district schools.
