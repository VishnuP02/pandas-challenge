Task: Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
Background: For this assignment, I had to put myself in a position as the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I then aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
